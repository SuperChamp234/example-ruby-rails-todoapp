# A simple Todo site

This was made using ruby on rails, using scaffolding.

- Ruby Version 3.0.3, Rails version 6.1.4.4
- Database can be initialized by
  - Updating credentials in config/database.yml, currently uses psql.
  - and then command `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate` to initialize database.
- After that, just run `rails s` to start!
